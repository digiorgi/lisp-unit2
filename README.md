## lisp-unit

*lisp-unit* is a Common Lisp library that supports unit testing. It is
an extension of the [library written by Chris Riesbeck][orig]. There
is a long history of testing packages in Lisp, usually called
"regression" testers. More recent packages in Lisp and other languages
have been inspired by [JUnit for Java][JUnit].

[Documentation is located on the project wiki.][wiki]

### How to use lisp-unit

The core definitions of *lisp-unit* may be used by loading the single
